# readux-promesa

A middleware function implementing automatic resolution and dispatching
of [promesa](https://github.com/funcool/promesa)-based promises.

```
#(rdc/dispatch 
  store
  :FETCH_POSTS 
  [(p/promise (fn [done err](err 20))) "something" "else"])

;; Dispatches :FETCH_POSTS_PENDING
;;   data: {:data ("something" "else")}
;; ... when promise is resolved
;; Dispatches :FETCH_POSTS_ERROR
;;   data:  {:data ("something" "else")
;;           :payload nil
;;           :error 20}
```

```
#(rdc/dispatch 
  store
  :FETCH_POSTS 
  [(p/promise (fn [done err](done 10))) "something"])

;; Dispatches :FETCH_POSTS_PENDING
;;   data: {:data ("something" "else")}
;; ... when promise is resolved
;; Dispatches :FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS
;;   data:  {:data ("something")
;;           :payload 10}
```
